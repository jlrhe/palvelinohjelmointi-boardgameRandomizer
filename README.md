# palvelinohjelmointi-boardgameRandomizer
This is a project for server programming course at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences.

Goal is to make a Spring Boot application with Maven and Thymeleaf, styled with Bootstrap which uses a database, REST API, Spring security and junit testing.

Consept:
The application will allow you to:
  -sign in/sign up 
  -show a list of your owned boardgames
  -add/remove boardgames
  -import your boardgame list from boargamegeek API
  -search owned games
  -randomly select a game you own
  
If time permits I will also: 
  -add filters for gametype, amount of players etc. to the search and randomizer
  -make it possible to view the gamelists of other users and include those in your search and randomizer (to allow randomizing from any game owned by anyone of the gaming group)
